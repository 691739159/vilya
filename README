The Vilya library
-----------------

The Vilya library provides various facilities for making networked multiplayer
games. Its various packages include:

  * whirled - builds on the crowd framework and defines a scene graph with
    portals to move between scenes and provides hooks for distributing and
    updating scene data (for example isometric rendering information) over
    the network
  * parlor - builds upon the crowd framework to create the notion of a
    game with players and provides tools for making turn based games
  * puzzle - builds on the parlor and media frameworks to provide tools
    for implementing puzzle games in a networked environment
  * micasa - builds on the parlor framework to provide lobbies and
    matchmaking for multiplayer games 

Documentation is somewhat sparse at the moment, but inspection of the code in
the tests/ directory shows examples of use of many features of the library.

Building
--------

Building the library is very simple. First ensure that the necessary third
party jar files are available in the lib/ directory. See lib/README for a list
of the necessary third party jar files and how to get them.

The library is built using Ant, a modern build tool written in and for Java. If
you aren't already using Ant for other projects, it can be found here:

  http://ant.apache.org/

Invoke ant with any of the following targets:

  all: builds the distribution files and javadoc documentation
  compile: builds only the class files (dist/classes)
  javadoc: builds only the javadoc documentation (dist/docs)
  dist: builds the distribution jar files (dist/*.jar)

Distribution
------------

The Vilya library is released under the LGPL. The most recent version of the
library is available here:

Contribution
------------

Contributions to Vilya are welcome. Read-only access to the subversion
repository is available at:
